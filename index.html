            <h1>Satoshi VS Mark</h1>
            <h4>Who is Satoshi?</h4>
            <p>Satoshi is an author of Bitcoin and a billionare!</p>
            <p>We don't know who Satoshi is exactly but we can guess easily he was highly educated.</p>
            <p>He changed the world in his way and he is honored.</p>
            <h4>Then who is Mark?</h4>
            <p>Yes, it's me. Poorest student!</p>
            <p>I'd love to go to Stanford but I don't have money to attend. I'd like to learn programming, but I don't have even a computer.</p>
            <p>I'm here with only the oldest phone, which can not even play apps properly.</p>
            <p>What a destiny! Someone can create his kingdom in the science, but someone can not even learn. What a fuck destiny!</p>
            <p>I just want to learn! I just want to buy a computer! I just want to create my own one day!</p>
            <h3>Need your help, buddy! Give me your favor! I'll definitely say one day that you guys made me! Am I crazy? Yes, it's crazy!</h3>
